    "This notebook focuses on conducting sentiment analysis using labeled financial news data. This involves analysing the sentiment expressed in financial news articles and categorising them as positive, negative, or neutral. The task includes understanding the characteristics of the dataset, exploring its content, preprocessing the text data, selecting appropriate feature representation techniques, training sentiment classifiers, and evaluating their performance. The objective is to develop accurate sentiment analysis models tailored to the financial domain."
